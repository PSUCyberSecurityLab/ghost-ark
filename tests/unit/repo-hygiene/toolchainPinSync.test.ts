/**
 * Every place this repository acquires the TLA+ toolchain must name the same
 * version and the same digest.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * On 2026-08-11 three CI jobs went red at once. The cause was not a code change:
 * `tlaplus/tlaplus` re-uploaded `tla2tools.jar` to the **prerelease** tag
 * `v1.8.0`, which it does repeatedly. Same URL, different bytes.
 *
 * The integrity checks did their job and refused to run. What they could not
 * catch is that this repository had pinned that one tag in three files at three
 * DIFFERENT digests, and had a fourth path — the Makefile — that fetched it with
 * no check at all:
 *
 *   e22f8ffb…  scripts/run-proofs.sh      (recorded 2026-08-01)
 *   58d44845…  Dockerfile.reviewer        (recorded earlier, never reconciled)
 *   58d44845…  Dockerfile.reproducer
 *   (none)     Makefile bootstrap target
 *   ab323b79…  what the URL actually served that morning
 *
 * `artifacts-verify.yml` carried a comment asserting the pins "cannot drift to
 * different pins" because the workflow reads the digest from run-proofs.sh. That
 * was true of the workflow and false of the repository: two other files held a
 * different value, and the comment made the drift harder to notice, not easier.
 *
 * So this test asserts agreement across every site. It cannot tell you the pin is
 * CORRECT — only that the repository has one opinion instead of four. Correctness
 * is the digest check's job at fetch time, and immutability is why the pin now
 * points at v1.7.4, the newest non-prerelease.
