/**
 * Pins measured figures against drift ACROSS documents.
 *
 * Every defect found in the 2026-08-02 Phase 0 audit had one shape: a number
 * measured once, quoted in several documents, then re-measured in exactly one of
 * them. The corrections were applied where the defect was noticed and nowhere
 * else. Concretely, on that day:
 *
 *   - E3's verifier-intrinsic count was 26/26 live and 25/25 in README.md,
 *     00_THESIS.md, the dissertation, and the reviewer attack sheet;
 *   - E5's peer-unanimity count was 28/28 live and 25/25 in three documents;
 *   - E7's divergence-class count was 8 live and 4 in four documents;
 *   - E1's alphabet was 31 classes live and 12 in README.md and the dissertation,
 *     while EXPERIMENTS.md already had it right — the update reached the source
 *     of record and stopped there;
 *   - the test suite was 1223/159 while three documents claimed three DIFFERENT
 *     stale values (706/105, 706/105, 640/97), two of them labelled "exact";
 *   - the Rust gateway ran 13 tests while README-AE claimed 7.
 *
 * `retractionSync.test.ts` solved this for retractions. This file solves it for
 * measured figures, and `paperEvidenceSource.test.ts` solves it for the source
 * a figure is drawn from. All three exist because the same failure recurred in
 * a place nobody had thought to check.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO. It enforces *agreement*, not *truth*: every document
 * could agree on a wrong number and this file would pass. Truth is the job of
 * the experiment harnesses, which re-derive their figures from a real run — see
 * the `command` on each fact below, and E4, which checks that a detection stops
 * when its mechanism is broken. Tier 1 below is the exception: those figures are
 * recomputed from the tracked tree, so they ARE checked against ground truth.
