/**
 * Keeps the conference manuscript from sourcing evidence out of `dab/bench/`.
 *
 * `dab/bench/` is quarantined: its own README opens "QUARANTINED: not evidence
 * about Ghost-Ark", because several suites there report `detected: true` while
 * invoking no component under test. Its files import only `node:crypto` and
 * `node:perf_hooks`.
 *
 * That was recorded as R1 — against the *dissertation*. It was never propagated
 * to `docs/paper/main.tex`, which went on headlining `global_advantage: 0` and
 * an end-to-end `p50 = 5.5 us` from that directory, in its abstract, its
 * contributions list, and its artifact appendix, with no retraction section
 * anywhere in the file. Found and corrected 2026-08-02 as R10.
 *
 * The shape of the failure is worth naming, because it is the third instance:
 * a correction landed in the document where the defect was noticed and nowhere
 * else. `retractionSync.test.ts` pins EXPERIMENTS.md against the dissertation.
 * This file pins the manuscript against the quarantine.
 *
 * No LaTeX toolchain is assumed, so this checks the source, not a built PDF.
