# Ghost-Ark — USENIX Artifact Evaluation orchestration
#
# Paper-evidence command for reviewers: make paper-evidence
#
# `make reproduce` remains a broader legacy artifact roll-up. It invokes
# quarantined DAB bench material for disclosure, so it is not the manuscript's
# evidence target.
#
# Every target runs REAL commands and reports REAL status. Nothing here
# manufactures a green result. See docs/artifact/repository_inventory.md for the
# honest, evidence-backed status of each stage (including known HEAD blockers).
