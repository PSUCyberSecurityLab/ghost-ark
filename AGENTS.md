# AGENTS.md — Ghost-Ark engineering doctrine

**Read this file before making changes in this repository.** It governs everyone
who edits Ghost-Ark: human contributors and coding assistants alike. The rules
below are tool-neutral on purpose — every one of them exists because this
repository violated it and the violation was caught in audit, and none of them
becomes less true depending on who is holding the keyboard.

[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) is the human-facing twin of this file, written
as onboarding rather than as doctrine. The duplication is deliberate. Where the two
disagree, **that disagreement is a bug** — fix both in the same commit.

## Mission and claim boundary

Ghost-Ark is an AWS-native reference implementation of bounded governance receipts,
deterministic enforcement primitives, and externally checkable evidence for LLM and
agentic AI systems. It exists to make narrow infrastructure claims auditable.

The boundary, stated once and enforced mechanically:

> Ghost-Ark provides cryptographic receipts and bounded governance evidence. It
> verifies what was recorded, signed, policy-bounded, and replayable under
> Ghost-Ark verifier rules. It does not prove semantic safety, truth, compliance,
> alignment, production readiness, or deployment correctness.

It is not an AI safety certificate, a compliance certificate, or a truth oracle.

## Stack

- Primary: TypeScript, Node.js, npm workspaces, Vitest, AWS CDK, Terraform, JSON Schema.
- Secondary: Rust (`dab/`, `tools/experiments*/`), TLA+ (`proofs/`), Python only for AWS
  Glue jobs, the independent verifier arm, and AWS-gated test helpers already present in
  `services/transform/glue/jobs/`, `verifiers/python/`, and `tests/aws/dev-account/`.
- Do not introduce Python project structure, `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, or
  pytest unless the touched area is already Python and the task explicitly requires it.

## Fast Commands

- Install: `npm ci`
- Typecheck/build: `npm run lint`
- Unit/integration tests: `npm test`
- Full local gate: `npm run validate`
- Fast local gate: `npm run validate:fast`
- Claim boundary check: `npm run scan:claims`
- Focused Vitest: `npx vitest run <path>`
- Terraform check: `terraform fmt -check -recursive infra/terraform`
- Rust: `cargo test --locked` in each of the four crates
- Proofs: `bash tools/proofs/run-tlc.sh`

Run focused tests for the files you touch. Run `npm run validate` before any commit that
changes runtime code, security-sensitive code, documented claims, schemas, CI, CDK,
Terraform, or public examples.

**Never pipe a gate through `tail`, `head`, or `grep` inside an `&&` chain.** The pipeline
exit code is the last command's, so a failing suite reads as success. This has produced a
false green in this repository more than once; use `set -o pipefail` or redirect to a file.

## Operating Rules

Before modifying files, state:

1. files to inspect

2. files to create

3. files to modify

4. tests to add or update

5. commands to run

6. risk of the change

7. what will not be claimed

Do not commit unless explicitly instructed.

Do not run AWS deployment commands unless explicitly instructed.

Do not weaken tests, schemas, canonicalization, signature validation, tenant-boundary checks, or claim boundaries.

## Forbidden Commands Without Human Approval

- `cdk deploy`
- `terraform apply`
- Mutating `aws ...` commands, including writes, deletes, KMS calls, Bedrock calls, and live smoke tests.
- `git push --force`
- `git reset --hard`
- `git clean -fd`
- Arbitrary `curl`/`bash` install scripts or remote shell installers.

## Required Validation

For normal changes:

npm run lint

npx vitest run <new-or-modified-test-file>

For significant changes:

npm run lint

npm test

Do not claim success without command output or explicit limitation.

## Non-Claims

Never claim or imply:

- production-ready

- safe AI

- proves safety

- compliant

- compliance-certified

- formally verified

- trustless

- zero-knowledge

- secure by default

- prevents all attacks

- guarantees safety

- absolute-security language

- deployment-safety certification

- production enclave security

Allowed only in explicit limitation, warning, policy, research-only, or non-claim contexts.

## Claim Rules

Allowed claim shape: "Given receipt R, policy hash H, signature S, key manifest K, and checkpoint C, an external verifier can check the recorded binding under Ghost-Ark verifier rules."

Do not publicly claim:

- Do not claim that Ghost-Ark proves AI safety.
- Do not claim that Ghost-Ark guarantees safe model behavior, model safety, or alignment.
- Do not claim that Ghost-Ark eliminates all risk.
- Do not claim that Ghost-Ark is fully trustless or unbreakable.
- Do not claim that Ghost-Ark certifies regulatory compliance, SOC2, HIPAA, FedRAMP, ISO 42001, or NIST status.
- Do not claim that Ghost-Ark proves truthfulness or semantic correctness of model outputs.
- Do not claim that Ghost-Ark executes live zk proofs, live Nitro Enclaves, or formal proofs without checked-in implementation and evidence.

When adding README/docs/marketing copy, classify each claim using `docs/research/ASSURANCE_MATURITY_LADDER.md`. Separate implemented behavior, mock interfaces, schemas, documented designs, and future work.

## Mock Vs Real Boundary

- Mock verifiers must be named `Mock*`.
- Mock data must say it is non-cryptographic, test-only, or simulation-only.
- Never claim mock verifier output is a real zk, Nitro, or formal proof.

## Core Project Thesis

Ghost Protocol = doctrine and threat model.

Ghost-Ark = AWS-native evidence/control-plane implementation.

CC-Framework = measurement science for correlated guardrail failure.

Unified thesis:

Verifiable Agent Governance under Correlated Guardrail Failure.

## Current Baseline

Measured at head on 2026-08-01. Re-measure before quoting; do not copy a stale number
forward. The previous entry in this file read "86/86 test files, 559/559 tests" while the
actual suite was 133 files and 849 tests — a documented baseline that disagreed with reality
on the first thing a reviewer checks.

- npm run lint passes

- npm test passes: 172 test files, 1,434 tests (1 file / 9 tests skipped) in the recorded green snapshot measured 2026-08-12 (supersedes 165 / 1274 of 2026-08-11).
  Treat it as a lower-bound snapshot, not an exact live total: re-measure before quoting, require the current suite to be green, and treat only a *decrease* as suspicious.
  **This line read "162 files, 1253 tests, passes" on 2026-08-04 while `npm test` was
  actually RED**: `publicInterface.test.ts` exceeded the 15s timeout and failed
  deterministically, in isolation, on a clean tree. See the ReDoS entry below. The suite
  was not re-run after the commit that broke it.

- Claim scanner: the 2026-08-14 evidence snapshot records 942 tracked files and 0 forbidden-claim violations via
  `node tools/research/check-forbidden-claims.mjs --tracked`. The ordinary `npm run scan:claims` count is working-tree-relative;
  do not quote it as an exact live total. Both counts change when scannable files are added or removed.

- npm audit: 5 advisories (3 high, 2 moderate), all dev-only, measured 2026-08-06. This
  figure has been wrong twice. It drifts **without any local change**, because advisories
  are published against dependencies you already have — re-measure on the day you quote it.

- npm run claims:verify: 20 claims, 12 distinct local commands, 12 passed / 0 failed
  (2026-08-02); 5 skipped as AWS-required by declaration

- npm run assumptions: 7 annotated modules, 0 lattice violations

- cargo test --locked: 33 Rust tests pass across 4 crates — 16 dab/gateway + 13 dab/verifier
  + 4 tools/experiments + 0 tools/experiments-json (that crate has **no tests**); clippy clean
  under -D warnings. Re-measured 2026-08-14 after the gateway's decoded-egress
  byte-binding tests were added. This line previously read "26 ... (13 + 13)",
  counting two crates and omitting the other two.

- tools/proofs/run-tlc.sh: 5 TLA+ baselines clean, 5 mutants violate as required
  (measured 2026-08-12; previously 4+4). Note the two runners disagree in scope and
  both are right: `run-tlc.sh` gates 5+5, while `artifacts/proofs/proofs_summary.json`
  (via `make proof`) records **6 clean baselines and 5 mutants** —
  `DAB_ExecutionBoundary` is checked clean over 51,106 states but has **no seeded
  mutant**, so its result is one-sided. `TenantIsolation` was a `DECLARED_STUB` until
  2026-08-12: its old invariant restated the guard of the only action that could
  create an allow entry (no behaviour could violate it) and its log was unbounded (TLC
  could not terminate). It now models mutable ownership with a decision-time cache,
  checks clean over 149,796 distinct states (count matches the expectation
  pre-registered in proofs/tla/README.md), and its mutant — ownership transfer that
  does not invalidate the cache — violates NoCrossTenantAllow as required. The paper
  claimed "five mutants" until 2026-08-02, when there were four; a fifth exists as of
  2026-08-12. Do not write "six mutants": DAB_ExecutionBoundary still has none.

  **Toolchain pinned to tla2tools v1.7.4 (2026-08-11), and only baseline counts are
  evidence.** Two findings, both from CI going red:

  1. `v1.8.0` is a **prerelease whose asset is re-uploaded under the same tag**. This
     repository pinned it in three files at three *different* digests and fetched it in
     a fourth (the Makefile) with **no check at all**; on 2026-08-11 the live bytes
     matched none of the three and three jobs failed. The integrity check worked — it
     refused an unrecognised jar — but a pin on a rolling tag fails on upstream's
     schedule rather than on evidence. Worse, the committed proof logs were split across
     *two* toolchains: `proofs/tla/` came from TLC 2.19 (v1.7.4) and `proofs/dab/` from
     the 2026-07-15 prerelease build. The declared pin matched neither consistently.
     v1.7.4 is the newest non-prerelease, unchanged since 2024-08-08; all nine committed
     logs are now regenerated under it, and `toolchainPinSync.test.ts` fails if any site
     drifts again or if the pin returns to a prerelease.
  2. **Mutant `distinct_states` counts are not reproducible and are retracted (R11).**
     Baselines exhaust their bounded state space, so their counts are model properties
     and re-derived byte-identically across the toolchain change: 403,949 / 529 / 64 /
     1,321 / 51,106. A mutant halts at the *first* counterexample under `-workers auto`,
     so the count depends on thread scheduling. Measured n=10 per mutant, one host, one
     commit, one jar: **61–63 / 193–431 / 22–23 / 185–332**. The previously published
     `63 / 396 / 22 / 221` are single draws printed as constants. The earlier diagnosis
     — that a macro discipline "covered baselines and skipped mutants" — was wrong; the
     numbers were never stable, so no discipline over them could have helped. **The gate
     is unaffected**: `VIOLATION_REPRODUCED` is a yes/no verdict and every mutant
     violates on every run. Report the verdict; never a bare mutant count.

- GitHub Actions: ci, artifacts-verify, and artifact-evaluation all green on main
  (2026-08-01). Before this date CI had failed on main for 40+ consecutive runs
  while CI_COVERAGE.md described the same artifacts as verified. Check the badge
  state, not the document, before believing either.

Load sensitivity, observed 2026-08-04 and **DIAGNOSED AND FIXED 2026-08-06**. The original
entry recorded that two concurrent full suites produced 3 failures which four sequential
runs could not reproduce, and asked that the test names be captured on recurrence. It
recurred, the name was captured, and the cause was mundane:

`tests/unit/experiments/kernelProbe.test.ts` called `probeKernel()` eight times. Each call
spawns one **synchronous** `execFileSync` process per pathology class — 31 classes, so ~248
process spawns per run, of which ~155 were redundant because the eight calls cover only
three distinct canonicalizers. Isolated that costs 3.4s; under full-suite parallelism,
where vitest runs many files at once and spawn latency balloons, it took **30.9s against
the 15s per-test timeout**. Nothing was algorithmically wrong — the suite was simply
oversubscribing the CPU with synchronous spawns.

Fixed with the same memoize-and-pre-warm pattern already recorded below for the CDK-synth
flake, not by raising a timeout. Verified under the adversarial condition rather than the
convenient one: two concurrent full suites now both report 164 files / 1270 tests green,
and the isolated file dropped 3.4s → 2.2s. **Do not reintroduce a per-test `probeKernel()`
call.**

One latent mismatch is left deliberately unchanged and is worth knowing: `runTarget`'s
internal `timeout: 30_000` is larger than vitest's 15s per-test timeout, so the inner guard
can never fire before vitest kills the test. The 30s bound is correct for the probe's
standalone use, which is not under a test runner; the two limits simply serve different
callers.

Known flake, fixed: two CDK-synth tests exceeded the 15s global vitest timeout under
parallel load, making npm test nondeterministically red on a clean clone. The synth is now
memoized and pre-warmed in beforeAll. Do not reintroduce a per-test synth in
infra/cdk/test/api-stack-governed-invoke.test.ts or tests/integration/api/template-auth.test.ts.

Anti-drift guards (added 2026-08-02, after Phase 0 found the same defect eleven times).
Every one was discriminator-checked: a defect was reintroduced and the guard confirmed to
fail before being accepted.

- `tests/unit/repo-hygiene/retractionSync.test.ts` — the two retraction lists carry the
  same ID set, both directions.
- `tests/unit/repo-hygiene/measuredFigureConsistency.test.ts` — a measured figure must
  read the same in every document that quotes it. Corpus size and the TLC baseline/mutant
  split are recomputed from the tracked tree rather than asserted.
- `tests/unit/repo-hygiene/paperEvidenceSource.test.ts` — the manuscript may not source
  evidence from quarantined directories, and every macro and `\ref` must resolve.
- `tests/unit/repo-hygiene/citedCommandsResolve.test.ts` — every command cited to a
  reviewer must exist.
- `tests/unit/repo-hygiene/workflowHardening.test.ts` (added 2026-08-06) — every action
  pinned to a 40-hex commit with a version comment; no `inputs.` / `github.event.` /
  `github.head_ref` interpolated into a `run:` block; every workflow declares a concurrency
  group; no deploy workflow cancels mid-apply. All five discriminator-checked.

**A guard that reports green because it never ran (found 2026-08-06).** Two independent
defects in `publicInterface.test.ts`, and they are worth reading together:

1. Its free-mail pattern began `[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@`, which backtracks quadratically on a
   long run of local-part characters containing no `@`. Commit d2fb8e8 generated
   `tools/kernel-probe/kernel-probe.mjs`, which embeds a 65,536-character run of `x` and
   contains no `@` at all. One file took the scan from 94ms to **12.9 seconds** — past the
   15s suite timeout. The repository generated its own denial-of-service input. The local
   part is now bounded to RFC 5321's 64 octets, which is the specification's number rather
   than a tuned one: 13,478ms → 29ms, identical verdicts.
2. Its `SCANNABLE` extension list omitted `.tex`, `.tf`, `.cfg`, `.mts`, `.html`, and the
   extensionless build files. `docs/paper/main.tex` — the manuscript — carried a personal
   free-mail address the whole time. The guard passed because it never opened the file.

**Do not fix a timing-out guard by raising the timeout.** `make unit` passes
`--test-timeout=60000` and would have hidden defect 1 indefinitely while `npm test`, which
CI runs, stayed red. Fix the quadratic, then re-measure.

These enforce **agreement, not truth**: all documents could agree on a wrong number and
they would pass. Truth is the experiment harnesses' job, and E4's. When one of these fires,
re-derive the figure with the command named in the failure message — do not edit the
expectation to match the document.

Public-surface rules: `docs/artifact/PUBLIC_INTERFACE.md` states what belongs in this
repository now that it is published under an institutional account — no career
correspondence, no commercial planning, no developer machine paths, no self-assigned
grades. Enforced by `tests/unit/repo-hygiene/publicInterface.test.ts`.

Recent hardening areas:

- receipt canonicalization

- signature envelope validation

- execution nonce consistency

- replay compatibility

- base64 signature validation

- KMS/HMAC signing boundaries

- CDK/security environment assertions

Do not undo these hardening changes.

## Safe Edit Zones

Agents may usually edit these with focused tests:

- `packages/research-frontier/src/**`
- `tests/unit/research-frontier/**`
- `schemas/research/**`
- `docs/research/**`
- `docs/compliance/**`
- `tools/research/**`
- `examples/sample-receipts/**`

Agents must edit these carefully and run broader tests:

- `packages/enforcement-runtime/src/**`
- `packages/receipt-schema/src/**`
- `packages/policy-compiler/src/**`
- `services/signing/kms/**`
- `services/ledger/dynamodb/**`
- `apps/api/src/**`
- `infra/cdk/**`
- `infra/terraform/**`
- `.github/workflows/**`

Do not edit without explicit human approval:

- Live AWS deployment workflows, prod environment settings, IAM trust policies, KMS key policy behavior, destructive cleanup scripts, secret names/paths, tenant namespace derivation, public cryptographic examples, and checked-in validation evidence under `evidence/live-aws-validation/**`.

## Empirical and Statistical Rules

These are binding. Each exists because this repository violated it and the violation was
found in audit. Full detail in docs/research/EXPERIMENTS.md.

No point estimate without a dispersion measure. Latency is p50 with IQR, never a bare p50.

No proportion without its denominator, and no detection rate without a control arm. A
verifier that rejects everything scores 100% detection and is useless; the control arm is
what makes the number mean anything.

No confidence interval over a curated census. A CI describes sampling variability under
repeated random draws. A hand-authored corpus has none: it is the whole population and its
size is an authoring decision. Use reportProportion with provenance "census" and report exact
counts. A Wilson interval was once computed at n = 2 and called a robust lower bound; at 2/2
that lower bound is below 0.4.

No interval below n = 30 (MIN_N_FOR_PROPORTION_INTERVAL), even for genuine random samples.

No hypothesis selected from the same data used to bound it. Discovery and confirmation are
separate tiers.

Pre-register intent before measuring. E1's consumer intents live in
tools/experiments/kernelAlphabet.ts and are pinned by a test, so editing one to match a
result surfaces in review.

State the host for any timing claim. A latency figure without a machine is not reproducible.

Report what was not measured. A silently dropped arm makes the system look better than it is.

A detection benchmark must invoke a real component. If a check would still report
"detected" when the mechanism it depends on is broken, it is tautological and measures
nothing. Apply the E4 discriminator: break the mechanism, confirm detection stops. Do not add
new benchmarks to dab/bench, which is quarantined for exactly this defect.

Never present a placeholder as measured output. The string "sha256:A" once appeared inside a
block labelled "Raw Benchmark Output" in the dissertation, emitted by the benchmark itself.

## Receipt Rules

Preserve deterministic canonical JSON.

Reject host-language non-JSON objects before signing.

Do not claim RFC 8785 / JCS compliance unless explicitly implemented and tested.

Receipt v1 compatibility matters. Do not change semantic multiplicity of fields such as action_taken without a schema migration.

## Signature Rules

Signing proves signing authorization over the receipt payload. It does not prove the AI output is true or safe.

Local HMAC is dev-only.

KMS signing is intended AWS mode.

KMS key IDs in verification-critical paths should be immutable key ARNs, not mutable aliases.

KMS signing does not prove hardware attestation or runtime integrity.

Do not claim Nitro Enclave/PCR-bound execution integrity unless an explicit AWS-supported attestation flow is implemented and tested.

## AWS Reality Boundary

Never claim the full cloud path exists unless it has live AWS evidence.

Distinguish:

- local-only

- AWS-synth-only

- AWS-live

- research-only

- aspirational

- non-claim

Target cloud architecture:

Cloud Security Evidence Analyst Agent on AWS.

Future path:

API Gateway

Cognito / Lambda authorizer

Governed Invoke Lambda

Policy repository

Server-side retrieval provider

Bedrock Guardrails input assessment

Read-only tool gateway

Allowlisted Bedrock model invocation

Post-model policy and redaction

Bedrock Guardrails output assessment

KMS-signed decision receipt

DynamoDB receipt ledger

S3 Object Lock checkpoint bundle

CloudWatch/X-Ray trace binding

Sanitized evidence bundle

CC-Framework observation export

## AWS And Secrets

- Do not run live AWS commands, CDK deploys, Terraform applies, Bedrock calls, KMS operations, or smoke tests that can spend money unless the user explicitly authorizes that exact action.
- Never read `.env`, `~/.aws/credentials`, `~/.ssh/*`, browser credential stores, or OS credential managers.
- Never print environment variables, tokens, private keys, AWS credentials, or MCP/agent config.
- Never commit, synthesize, copy, or move secrets.
- Prefer `npx cdk synth`, `terraform validate`, and local unit tests over live cloud operations.
- IAM, KMS, tenant isolation, signature verification, and receipt canonicalization are security-sensitive. Add negative tests for bypass, mismatch, replay, downgrade, and missing-context cases.

## Tool Gateway Boundary

Initial agent tools must be read-only.

Allowed initial tools:

- read CloudWatch alarm state

- read DynamoDB receipt metadata

- read sanitized S3 evidence bundles

- query Athena read-only datasets

- search evidence index if configured

- summarize sanitized deployment outputs

Forbidden initial tools:

- delete resources

- modify IAM

- rotate keys

- write production data

- send emails

- create external side effects

- execute arbitrary shell in cloud

No tool use without receipt semantics.

## Workspace Boundaries

- Do not write outside the repository workspace.
- Do not follow or write through symlinks that resolve outside the repository root.

## Coding Style

- Follow existing TypeScript patterns. Keep modules small and deterministic.
- Use explicit types for public interfaces, schemas for external artifacts, and canonical serialization helpers where integrity matters.
- Fail closed on missing tenant, policy, key, receipt, attestation, or verifier context.
- Add comments only where they explain a non-obvious security or cryptographic boundary.

## Frontier Task Preference

If asked to run the frontier cartographer task, prefer this bounded sequence:

1. Create docs/research/INVISIBLE_FRONTIER_PROBLEMS.md

2. Create docs/claims/CLAIM_EVIDENCE_ATTACK_MAP.md

3. Create schemas/ghost_claim_evidence_attack_map.v1.json

4. Create docs/architecture/CLOUD_AGENT_GOVERNANCE_TARGET.md

5. Implement tools/claims/scan-claims.ts

6. Create docs/claims/CLAIM_LANGUAGE_POLICY.md

7. Create tests/integration/claims/claimLanguagePolicy.test.ts

8. Run lint and targeted tests

9. Run full tests if practical

Do not implement Bedrock Guardrails, server-side retrieval, tool gateway, formal model, and claim scanner all in one pass.

## Commit And PR Format

Commit messages use `<area>: <imperative summary>`, for example
`ci: run the forbidden-claim scanner in validate`. The body states what changed, what is
implemented versus documented versus mocked, what was run, and the claim-boundary impact.

**Attribution rule, binding.** Commits carry exactly one author: the repository's
maintainer. Do **not** add `Co-Authored-By` trailers, `Generated with …` lines, tool
names, model names, or any other assistant attribution to a commit message, PR body, or
changelog entry. A commit is a statement by a person who takes responsibility for it; a
tool credit in that position confuses provenance with authorship, and the provenance of
the *evidence* — which is what this repository actually trades on — lives in the receipts
and the recorded experiment output, not in a trailer.

PRs must include:

- What changed
- Implemented vs documented vs mocked
- Tests run, with output
- Security/claim-boundary impact
- Rollback plan, naming the files or commit to revert and whether data, AWS resources, or
  public artifacts are affected
- Any human approvals required

## Completion Report

At the end of substantial work, report:

Files created:

Files modified:

Commands run:

Tests:

Remaining gaps:

Next highest-leverage task:

## North Star

A skeptical reviewer should be able to say:

I do not trust the author.

I do not trust the README.

I do not trust the model.

But I can inspect the receipt, replay the canonical digest, verify the signature, map the claim to evidence, inspect the non-claim, and reproduce the failure boundary.

# Execution Plan — 112 Steps

Written 2026-08-02 against measured repository state, not aspiration. Every step
names an acceptance criterion that is checkable by command. A step without a
passing acceptance criterion is not done, regardless of how much work went into
it.

**How to use this.** Work phases in order; within a phase, order is a
recommendation. Do not batch — each step is sized to be one commit with its
acceptance output in the message. When a step turns out to be wrong or already
done, strike it through with the evidence rather than deleting it: a silently
removed step is indistinguishable from one never planned.

**The brutal framing.** Phases 0–3 are debts already incurred. Phase 4 onward is
new work. If effort is limited, Phase 1 outranks everything else in this file:
no third party has ever run this artifact, and every other number here is
self-reported.

## Phase 0 — The record is currently wrong (do first, cheap)

1. Re-measure `npm audit`; CI_COVERAGE claims "8 high-severity advisories" and the actual count is 3 (1 high, 2 moderate). — Acceptance: the row matches `npm audit` output on the day of the commit.
2. ~~Add a dated "measured on" stamp to every numeric claim in CI_COVERAGE.~~ **DONE 2026-08-02, by a different route than proposed.** Stamping ~130 individual lines would have produced churn and a false uniformity — every row looking equally fresh regardless of whether anyone ran it. Instead the header now states exactly which commands were *executed* on the audit date and which rows are carried forward from an earlier run (TLC, E10 mutation score, semgrep count). A document-level "last audited" date that silently covers unexecuted rows is the defect, not the absence of per-line stamps.
3. ~~Audit CI_COVERAGE end to end against live commands.~~ **DONE 2026-08-02.** The `npm audit` row was already correct (step 1). Three rows were stale and are corrected: scan:claims 829→831, "E1's three unintended kernel members"→five, and E7's "four structural divergence classes"→eight over four mechanisms.
4. ~~Do the same for `README-AE.md`.~~ **DONE 2026-08-02, and this was the worst of the three.** Rows 2 and 3 instructed a reviewer to reproduce headline claims by running `dab/bench/run_all.ts` — the quarantined directory — and labelled the match "exact". Row 4 claimed 706 tests / 105 files against an actual 1223 / 159, also labelled "exact". Rows 8 and 8d claimed 7 gateway Rust tests against an actual 13. Every row 1–9 has now been executed: rows 5, 6, 7 pass as written; row 1 was corrected from "five mutants" to four.
5. ~~Do the same for `ARTIFACT_EVALUATION.md`.~~ **DONE 2026-08-02.** It listed "Attack — DAB bench ✅ pass" as a verification row and named it under "what a reviewer can verify today". Both now state the quarantine; an E3/E4 row replaces it.
6. ~~Grep the dissertation for claims retracted in EXPERIMENTS.md.~~ **DONE 2026-08-02, and the premise was wrong.** Every match in `04_Empirical_Evaluation.md` was already inside its own §6.0 Retractions table, and the chapter already deferred to EXPERIMENTS.md on conflict. No live retracted claim existed. The real defect was different and worse: the two retraction lists had **drifted in both directions** — R6/R7/R8 recorded in EXPERIMENTS.md and never propagated to the chapter, R9 retracted in the chapter and never propagated back. A reader consulting either document alone got an incomplete list of what this project has withdrawn, which is a worse failure than the original overclaims because it is the *correction* that was incomplete.
7. ~~Add a SUPERSEDED banner to each affected section.~~ **Superseded by 6.** No banner was needed; both tables now carry stable IDs R1–R9 and the chapter names EXPERIMENTS.md as the source of record.
8. ~~Write that hygiene test.~~ **DONE** — `tests/unit/repo-hygiene/retractionSync.test.ts`. Asserts ID-set equality in both directions, contiguous numbering so a deleted retraction leaves a gap, a floor of nine, a named tie-breaker, and that retracted phrases appear nowhere outside a retraction context. Discriminator-checked: removing one row from the chapter fails it.
9. ~~Reconcile `docs/paper/` against the same retraction list.~~ **DONE 2026-08-02, and it was the largest single defect found in Phase 0.** The manuscript had **no retraction section at all**, and drew its headline detection and latency numbers — in the abstract, the contributions list, §Evaluation, and the artifact appendix — from `dab/bench/`, whose own README opens "QUARANTINED: not evidence about Ghost-Ark". That is R1's defect: R1 was recorded against the *dissertation* and never propagated to the *paper*, a document neither retraction list was ever checked against. Recorded as **R10**. Re-sourced to E2 (p50 with IQR, parse-only baseline) and E3/E4 (real verifier, control arm, metamorphic guard). Withdrawn *without replacement*: the 140,941 ops/s throughput figure and the stage decomposition, because no superseding experiment measures them. Also found in the same pass: the paper claimed "five seeded mutants" when only four exist, and its four inline mutant state counts had drifted from the recorded run (61/240/232 vs 63/396/221) because the evidence-macro discipline covered baselines and skipped mutants. Pinned by `tests/unit/repo-hygiene/paperEvidenceSource.test.ts`.
10. ~~Verify every `docs/research/*.md` marked `core` still earns it.~~ **DONE 2026-08-02.** Seven core docs, and all seven earn the tier — verified by *running* the backing artifact, not by checking it exists: `00_THESIS.md` and `EXPERIMENTS.md` (12 and 14 command references, full suite run green), `EVIDENCE_PROVENANCE_LATTICE.md` (`ProvenanceLattice.tla` at 403,949 states + `provenanceLattice.test.ts`), `KERNEL_PROBE.md` (`npm run kernel-probe --command "jq -S -c ."` reproduces E11's `jq-sorted` row exactly: 4 kernel members, 5 over-discrimination), `PROVENANCE_KERNEL_PROBLEM.md` (`provenanceKernel.test.ts`), `NON_CLAIM_ENGINEERING.md` (`scan:claims`), `RECEIPT_TRUTH_LADDER.md` (`ghost_receipt_verify.mjs` + the malicious-receipt examples). The two test files ran 30/30 green.
11. ~~Demote any core doc without evidence.~~ **Not required** — no core doc failed step 10. Recorded rather than deleted so the check is visibly *done* rather than skipped.
12. ~~Publish a CLAIM_LEDGER mapping claim → command → last-verified date.~~ **DONE 2026-08-02, and this premise was wrong too.** The ledger already existed: `docs/governance/claim-evidence-matrix.md`, 20 claims with commands and statuses. The gap was that **nothing ever ran the commands** — a row could cite a renamed script or deleted test file and still read as evidence. Added `npm run claims:verify` (executes them, reports pass/fail with host and date) and `npm run claims:resolve` (static, wired into `npm run validate`). First execution: 12 distinct commands, 12 passed, covering 15 of 20 claims; the other 5 are `AWS-required` and skipped by declaration. Execution surfaced a defect in the matrix itself — CLAIM-020's command regenerated a committed fixture whose ECDSA signature is non-deterministic, so verifying it always dirtied the working tree. Output redirected to gitignored `artifacts/`, pinned by `claimMatrixResolves.test.ts`.

## Phase 1 — Third-party independence (the largest open weakness)

13. ~~Write a one-page reviewer brief: what to attack, what would falsify, what is already known-broken.~~ **DONE 2026-08-12, by a different route than proposed.** Not a brief about the repository — a *measurement of somebody else's system*, which is reviewable without reading this one because it is about theirs. Five reports filed against `json-canonicalize`, the JCS reference repo, `safe-stable-stringify`, `json-stable-stringify`, and `canonicalize`, each with a reproduction that runs from a published npm package rather than from this clone. A brief asks a stranger for attention; a finding about their code earns it.
14. **INITIATED 2026-08-12, NOT COMPLETE.** Five reports sent. The acceptance criterion is **"a reply exists"** and no reply exists yet, so this stays open. Filing is an action; a reply is the observation. Counting outbound messages as external validation would be this repository's own tautology defect committed one social layer up. Tracked in `docs/validation/EXTERNAL_KERNEL_PROBE_REPORTS_2026-08-12.md`.
15. Record their findings verbatim in `docs/validation/`, including ones that are wrong. — Acceptance: findings file with attribution and date. **Receiving structure built 2026-08-12** (same file), with the disposition log empty and a stated ranking of which replies are most valuable — a maintainer saying "your intent is wrong" ranks first, because the alphabet is what F2 attacks and the part this project can least verify alone.
16. Fix what they find, or record why not. — Acceptance: each finding has a disposition.
17. Ask a second reviewer to reimplement the receipt verifier from `docs/` alone, without reading `verifiers/`. — Acceptance: an independent implementation exists.
18. Run E5 with that implementation as a fourth arm. — Acceptance: disagreement count reported, whatever it is.
19. If it disagrees, treat that as the most important result in the repository. — Acceptance: a finding written before any fix.
20. Publish `kernel-probe` results for three canonicalizers this project does not control and did not choose (ask the reviewer to pick). — Acceptance: three reports committed.
21. Open a GitHub issue template for external kernel-probe reports. — Acceptance: template exists and is linked from KERNEL_PROBE.md.
22. Add a `CONTRIBUTORS.md` recording every external contribution. — Acceptance: gated by `docs:check`.

## Phase 2 — E10 beyond the receipt kernel

23. Extend `mutationScope.ts` to a second declared scope: `enforcement-runtime/src/policy/` (8 files). — Acceptance: import-graph pin passes for the new scope.
24. Sweep policy. — Acceptance: a per-file table committed.
25. Triage policy survivors into real-gap / equivalent with written arguments. — Acceptance: every survivor has a disposition.
26. Write tests for the real gaps. — Acceptance: re-sweep shows movement.
27. Re-measure and record before/after. — Acceptance: both numbers in EXPERIMENTS.md.
28. Repeat 23–27 for `runtime/` (8 files). — Acceptance: as above.
29. Repeat for `retrieval/` (6 files). — Acceptance: as above.
30. Repeat for `vault/` (5 files). — Acceptance: as above.
31. Repeat for `gateway/` (4 files). — Acceptance: as above.
32. Repeat for `bedrock/` (5 files). — Acceptance: as above.
33. Repeat for `tenancy/` (1 file) and `identity/` (1 file). — Acceptance: as above.
34. Repeat for `attestation/` (3 files). — Acceptance: as above.
35. Repeat for `proofs/` (3 files). — Acceptance: as above.
36. Repeat for `evidence/` (1 file) and `aws/` (1 file). — Acceptance: as above.
37. Publish one aggregate table across all scopes. — Acceptance: totals reconcile with the per-scope reports.
38. Set a `break` threshold per scope from measurement, never before it. — Acceptance: each threshold is under its measured value.
39. Add the new scopes to `mutation.yml`. — Acceptance: the scheduled run covers them.
40. Record wall-clock per scope so the schedule stays feasible. — Acceptance: durations in EXPERIMENTS.md.

## Phase 3 — The 223 survivors and 40 unreached mutants in the receipt kernel

41. `signer.ts` — 57 survivors, the largest single block. Triage all 57. — Acceptance: each classified with an argument.
42. Kill the base64/hex regex survivors that are genuinely killable. — Acceptance: re-sweep delta recorded.
43. Record the equivalent ones with the fixed-length-alphabet argument. — Acceptance: written in the test file, not a commit message.
44. `strictJsonAdmission.ts` — 40 survivors, mostly loop bounds. Triage. — Acceptance: each classified.
45. Prove or disprove the loop-bound equivalence claims one at a time. — Acceptance: no survivor left as "unexamined".
46. `verifier.ts` — 39 survivors, never remediated. Triage and remediate. — Acceptance: re-sweep.
47. `keyManifest.ts` — 29 survivors, 10 unreached. Remediate. — Acceptance: unreached → 0.
48. `hashCanonicalization.ts` — 20 survivors, 8 unreached. Remediate. — Acceptance: unreached → 0.
49. `canonical.ts` — 18 survivors. Remediate. — Acceptance: re-sweep.
50. `kmsSigner.ts` — 7 survivors, 6 unreached, and the lowest-scoring file at 68.2%. Remediate. — Acceptance: unreached → 0.
51. `kmsVerifier.ts` — 5 survivors. Argue each or kill it. — Acceptance: no unexamined survivor.
52. `chain.ts` and `emission.ts` — 4 each. Finish them. — Acceptance: no unexamined survivor.
53. Decide the fate of the unreachable `emission.ts:134` terminal throw. — Acceptance: removed with a test, or annotated as intentionally-dead with a comment explaining why it stays.
54. Re-sweep the full kernel. — Acceptance: aggregate ≥ 90% covered, unreached ≤ 10.
55. Raise `break` to just under the new measured total. — Acceptance: `mutationScope.test.ts` green.
56. Write the equivalent-mutant catalogue as one document. — Acceptance: every claimed-equivalent mutant appears with its argument.

## Phase 4 — Formal methods

57. ~~`TenantIsolation.tla` is an unchecked stub and tenant isolation is a headline claim. Write it to a checkable state.~~ **DONE 2026-08-12.** The stub had two defects: a tautological invariant (NoCrossTenantAllow restated the guard of the only action that appended "allow") and an unbounded log (no constraint, so TLC could not terminate). Rebuilt with mutable ownership, a decision-time cache the grant path reads instead of the authoritative owner, and MaxLog. TLC: clean, 149,796 distinct states — exactly the count pre-registered in proofs/tla/README.md before the run (4 owner maps × Σₖ₌₀..₅ 8ᵏ log sequences).
58. ~~Write its mutant.~~ **DONE 2026-08-12.** `TenantIsolationMutant.tla` seeds one named defect: `TransferMutant` changes ownership without invalidating the decision cache. NoCrossTenantAllow violated in a 3-state trace (transfer resourceA away, grant to the old owner via the stale cache). Discriminator-checked: restoring the invalidation line makes the mutant run clean and `run-tlc.sh` fail with "mutant passed; property not load-bearing".
59. ~~Add both to `run-tlc.sh`.~~ **DONE 2026-08-12.** Gate now 5 baselines / 5 mutants, exit 0; `run-proofs.sh` executes the pair instead of recording DECLARED_STUB.
60. `proofs/cloud/BigQueryIndex.tla` — check or delete. — Acceptance: TLC log committed, or the file is gone with a reason.
61. Same for `CloudConsistency.tla`. — Acceptance: as above.
62. Same for `ReceiptPublication.tla`. — Acceptance: as above.
63. Same for `StorageCheckpoint.tla`. — Acceptance: as above.
64. Write a mutant for every cloud spec that survives. — Acceptance: each violates.
65. Record TLC state counts for every spec. — Acceptance: a spec with a suspiciously small state space is investigated, not accepted.
66. Assert a minimum state count per spec in `run-tlc.sh`. — Acceptance: a vacuously-passing spec fails the gate.
67. Re-strip machine paths from newly generated TLC logs. — Acceptance: `publicInterface.test.ts` green.
68. Document what each spec does NOT model. — Acceptance: one coverage-boundary paragraph per spec.

## Phase 5 — Supply chain

69. Merge the 5 Rust patch bumps (#16, #17, #23, #24 and one more) one at a time. — Acceptance: `cargo test --locked` green per merge.
70. Merge the 4 minor npm bumps (#26, #28, #29, #30). — Acceptance: `npm run validate` green per merge.
71. `sha2 0.10 → 0.11` (#14, #22) is a RustCrypto trait break, not a patch. Port the code. — Acceptance: both crates compile and test.
72. `rand 0.8 → 0.10` (#21) is a major API change. Port. — Acceptance: gateway tests green.
73. `ed25519-dalek 2 → 3` (#12, #20) touches signing. Port with extreme care. — Acceptance: the socket round-trip evidence is regenerated, not assumed.
74. Re-record the DAB round-trip evidence after 73. — Acceptance: new recorded logs committed.
75. `typescript 6 → 7` (#27). Port. — Acceptance: `npm run lint` clean with no new `any`.
76. GitHub Actions majors (#11, #13, #15, #18, #19). — Acceptance: each workflow green after each bump.
77. Pin every action to a commit SHA. Semgrep reports 48 mutable-tag findings. — Acceptance: zero `github-actions-mutable-action-tag` findings.
78. Enable Dependabot for the new `tools/experiments-json` crate. — Acceptance: config lists it.
79. Re-run `npm audit`; drive the remaining 3 to 0 or record why not. — Acceptance: a dated row in CI_COVERAGE.
80. Raise the audit gate to the level actually met. — Acceptance: gate passes on a clean clone.

## Phase 6 — CI hardening

81. Triage all 96 semgrep findings into fix / suppress-with-reason / accept. — Acceptance: every finding has a disposition.
82. Fix the 23 `path-join-resolve-traversal` findings or argue each. — Acceptance: written argument per suppression.
83. Fix the 7 `hardcoded-hmac-key` findings — these are test vectors; make that unambiguous. — Acceptance: renamed or annotated so the scanner and a human agree.
84. Fix the 9 `contains-bidirectional-characters` findings. — Acceptance: zero remaining, or a test asserting they are intentional.
85. Raise the semgrep gate to the level met. — Acceptance: the job blocks on regression.
86. Replace the deprecated `returntocorp/semgrep-agent` image. — Acceptance: no deprecated image reference.
87. Add retry-on-transient to the semgrep pull. — Acceptance: a flake does not fail the build.
88. Make the mutation job blocking on a release branch. — Acceptance: a score regression fails that branch.
89. Add cross-machine E2 reproduction on a second runner architecture. — Acceptance: two hosts, two recorded p50+IQR figures.
90. Report the between-host difference honestly. — Acceptance: a dispersion statement, not an average.
91. Exercise `dab/roundtrip` in CI. — Acceptance: the socket round-trip runs, not just its recorded log.
92. Exercise `dab/k8s`. — Acceptance: as above, or a written reason it cannot run.
93. Exercise `dab/agent-runtime`. — Acceptance: as above.
94. Add a clean-clone smoke job that runs `npm ci && npm run validate` with no cache. — Acceptance: green, and it would have caught the ERESOLVE defect.

## Phase 7 — The AWS reality boundary

95. Cost-bound and approve one live AWS window. — Acceptance: written approval and a spend cap. **Requires a human decision.**
96. Execute the preflight runbook. — Acceptance: preflight output recorded.
97. Emit one KMS-signed receipt against real KMS. — Acceptance: a receipt whose `keyId` is a real key ARN.
98. Verify it with all three verifiers. — Acceptance: three verdicts, agreement or disagreement recorded.
99. Produce one sanitized live evidence bundle. — Acceptance: passes `validate:evidence-bundle`.
100. Run the cleanup runbook and record it. — Acceptance: no residual billable resources.
101. Move the KMS rows in CI_COVERAGE from `AWS-synth-only` to `AWS-live` — only for what actually ran. — Acceptance: no row upgraded without a recorded artifact.
102. Write down what the live window did NOT cover. — Acceptance: an explicit list.

## Phase 8 — Falsifier F2 (the real-traffic corpus)

103. Decide the licensing and provenance policy for third-party corpora. — Acceptance: written policy. **Requires a human decision.**
104. Identify three corpora this project did not author. — Acceptance: sources named with licences.
105. Vendor or fetch them under that policy. — Acceptance: provenance recorded per file.
106. Run E1's pathology classes against them to measure real-world incidence. — Acceptance: rates with denominators.
107. Report the rate with a genuine sampling interval where n ≥ 30 and provenance is `sampled`. — Acceptance: `reportProportion` attaches an interval legitimately.
108. State plainly whether F2 is closed, narrowed, or untouched. — Acceptance: 00_THESIS.md updated either way.

## Phase 9 — Publication and external utility

109. ~~Package `kernel-probe` so it runs without this repository.~~ **DONE 2026-08-04.** `tools/kernel-probe/kernel-probe.mjs`: one file, zero dependencies, four `node:` builtins, no install step. Acceptance executed rather than asserted — `kernelProbeStandalone.test.ts` copies it to a temp directory outside the repository and runs it there against a canonicalizer written into that same directory, so the test cannot pass by finding something in the clone and cannot *skip* for a missing `jq`/`python3` (a skipped parity test reports green while measuring nothing — the `dab/bench` defect). Verified from a clean room against jq (4 kernel members / 5 over-discrimination, matching E11's `jq-sorted` row exactly) and CPython. **It is generated, not copied**: the alphabet is emitted through the existing `--emit-alphabet` path, and the ~40 lines of ported verdict logic are held to `e1KernelCensus.classify` by an exhaustive branch-parity test. Both guards discriminator-checked — flipping a pre-registered intent and inverting a classifier branch each fail the suite. Not published to npm; that is an external release and the author's call.
    **Finding, from the tool doing its job:** stock CPython `json.dumps(sort_keys=True)` carries 5 unintended kernel members; adding `allow_nan=False` and nothing else takes it to 4, moving `non-finite-overflow` to `fail-closed`. Same library, same version, one keyword argument deciding whether the system can distinguish `NaN` from a number it was never given. Recorded in `tools/kernel-probe/README.md` as the worked example.
110. Write the standalone result: four ecosystems, three universal duplicate-key collapses, and the 2^53 finding that narrowed the claim. — Acceptance: a draft that stands without Ghost-Ark.
111. Decide the venue and the authorship, including the lab's role. — Acceptance: written. **Requires a human decision.**
112. Re-run every number in the draft from a clean clone on the day of submission. — Acceptance: each figure reproduced, with the command and host recorded.

## Feature freeze, declared 2026-08-12

**This repository is feature-frozen. The binding constraint is no longer artifact quality;
it is that almost nobody outside this project has run it.**

The record supports that plainly. The suite is 166 files and 1,311 tests, the TLA+ gate is
5 baselines and 5 mutants, the receipt kernel's two weakest files went to 96.4% and 98.1%
covered, and `@ghost-ark/kernel-probe@0.1.0` is on npm with a verified provenance
attestation. Against that, F2 — "unintended kernel members are an artifact of the curated
alphabet" — is exactly as open as it was in July, because closing it requires *other people*
running the alphabet, which no amount of local work produces. Plan step 14 has said so since
it was written: **this step cannot be completed by an assistant.**

So until external results exist, the following are the only changes worth making:

- Findings measured against systems this project does not control (see
  [JCS_CANONICALIZER_PROBE.md](./docs/research/JCS_CANONICALIZER_PROBE.md), the first of
  these).
- Fixes to defects those measurements surface.
- Whatever an external reviewer or upstream maintainer asks for.
- Security and dependency maintenance.

Not worth making: another mutation-score point, another spec, another subsystem. The 223rd
surviving mutant is a smaller improvement to this project than one issue filed against a
canonicalizer somebody else maintains. Phases 2–8 below stay written down and stay paused;
resume them when the external gap is no longer the largest one.

## What NOT to do

Do not add a new subsystem before Phase 3 finishes. The repository's credibility
is the ratio of claims made to evidence attached, and new surface without an
experiment behind it moves that ratio the wrong way. The quarantine directories
exist because that lesson was learned expensively, twice.

Do not raise a threshold before measuring. It has already been wrong once:
`break: 75` was set on two files' evidence when the full sweep held 60.6%. The
gate has since moved only after sweeps (75 -> 58 -> 70 -> 80); the current value
is `break: 80` in `stryker.config.json`, and `mutationThresholdSync.test.ts`
fails any document that states a different one.

Do not report a step complete without its acceptance output. "Should work" and
"works locally" have both been false in this repository within the last month —
the latter cost 40+ consecutive red CI runs.
