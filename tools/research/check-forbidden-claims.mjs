// E2/E3 hardening: normalize before matching, match across line breaks, and
// scope the non-claim allowance to the clause containing the phrase.
//
// Rationale (exploits this closes):
//   E2 — Unicode/confusable: a raw code-point regex is bypassed by homoglyphs
//        ("gυаrantee"), zero-width splits ("guar​antee"), fullwidth forms,
//        and NBSP separators. Matching now runs over a normalized form.
//   E3 — line-split: a phrase broken by a newline evaded per-line matching.
//        Matching now runs over the whole document with newlines folded.
//   E3 — allowance smuggling: the old check allowed a line if it merely CONTAINED
//        a marker like "is not"/"candidate", so "This is not a toy: Ghost-Ark is
//        production-ready and guarantees safety" passed. Allowance is now scoped
//        to the clause holding the phrase, so a disclaimer in a different clause
//        no longer excuses a claim.
//
// NON-CLAIM: the confusable map is a curated, bounded subset of UTS #39 (the
// Cyrillic/Greek Latin-lookalikes that NFKC does not fold), not the full
// confusable skeleton. It reduces, but does not eliminate, homoglyph evasion.
